# The DCU Raffle

## Requirments

* Simple system to raffle out prizes.
* Picks a winner at random out of an array. 
* The array is populated by the ticket numbers
* Ticket numbers will start at 1 to XXXXX
* Nice to have an easy way to set the max number
* Button is clicked and the raffle draws
* Button should be clickable on touch screen Epos screen
* Should be able to set the numer of prizes/ draws - Number of button clicks to draw
* Winning number cannot be drawn twice
* The winner will be displayed on the page
* Winners should stay persistent on the page, so when someone refreshes the numbers stay on the screen - saved to database.
* There will probably be confetti when the button is clicked or when a ticket is drawn - When the design is done more will become clear

## Unsure

- Should the ticket numbers be generated live on front end after a click on backend? If so this is more complicated and maybe using a pluigin may be better like raffle press or WP raffle. Or a live broadcast screenshare displayed on the front end of the site.
- The Page to be designed would maybe be better a static page displaying the winners with a simple design like the exampe here for the page to pick the winners. The page to pick the winners would only be visible to the admi. When running the draw they should maybe record the screen. When its done they poplulate the winners page with the winning ticket numbers via acf text fields.
